In each case we are going to review the actual method to approach the issue and the new method, using Hierarchy 4.0, to solve the problem at hand.\\nThe four case studies are 1)Restore a PSD 1 node without requiring a planned shutdown; 2)Evaluate the maintenance on a voting 2 out of 3 instruments; 3)Prepare the maintenance on 2 out of 3 voting where one instrument is already in fault; 4) Prepare a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of an unexpected shutdown.\\n\\nCASE STUDY 1 - Restore a PSD 1 node without requiring a planned shutdown, all while the plant remains in normal operation.\\nThis Case Study Challenge is to restore a rack connected to the PSD 1 node without requiring a planned shutdown, all while the plant remains in normal operation. \\nWhat is the actual method: engineer and operator must use the instrument list the get the Rack 2 number of modules (9 AI modules) and verify how many channels they have assigned (8  channels for 9 cards for a total of 72 I/O). This is required to get all the Input/Output connected the Rack 2. All signals that have been identified must be verified in the logical configuration using an engineering workstation: 1)Each signal must be individually inspected in the system applications for its logic function. 2)If a signal is used in multiple controllers, all logics must be cross examined again for all the references. 3)The engineer must prepare a report containing the listed logics and final elements affected during this process.\\nWhat are the actual issues and drawbacks in using the actual method: 1)There is a possibility of human error when checking the connection between signals and logics. \\n2) The Impact Analysis Report has not been correctly updated with the latest software modifications. 3)The troubleshooting process is time consuming due to the involvement of several specialists. 4)Other maintenance activities have been delayed as a result.\\nThe new method is to use Hierarchy 4.0 and you will have your solution in few simple steps.1)Gain access to Hierarchy 4.0 2)Enter Maintenance mode and select the nodes PSD1 and RACK2  3)Obtain the results of your research in a few seconds 4)Get a comprehensive overview of all signals allocated in the specified controller, with emphasis on the signals involved in the rack replacement 5)Easily identify all  the associations between the items and the impacted logics 6)Print from Hierarchy all pages that are affected by the rack replacement 7)Maintain full control of the activity.\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': './KS-all-info_rev1.txt'})]"
